Project Description
Useless GPS is a fun web app that plots a direct straight-line path between two places ignoring roads or terrain, and humorously comments on the journey‚Äôs geography through an anime character‚Äôs snarky pop-up messages.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes, we don‚Äôt want the best route ‚Äî we want the *most useless* path possible, ignoring roads or obstacles, just to see what ridiculous things happen along the way.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We solve this by drawing a straight line ‚ÄúGPS‚Äù path and analyzing terrain features along it with OpenStreetMap data ‚Äî then animating a sarcastic anime character‚Äôs commentary based on water, mountains, forests, buildings, and more. Because why not?
