Project Description
Useless GPS is a fun web app that ignores all logical navigation principles and draws a direct straight-line path between two places, regardless of roads, mountains, rivers, or oceans. Along the way, an anime character pops up with sarcastic, snarky, and dramatic commentary about the ridiculous ‚Äúroute‚Äù you‚Äôre taking.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes, Google Maps is just too helpful. What if we wanted directions that were‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ completely impractical? No roads, no safety, no common sense ‚Äî just the shortest path through everything in your way.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We ‚Äúsolve‚Äù this non-existent problem by:

Drawing a perfectly straight-line path between two points

Using OpenStreetMap data to detect terrain features (water, mountains, forests, cities, etc.) along the path

Triggering a sarcastic anime character to pop up with absurd commentary on your ‚Äújourney‚Äù
Because‚Ä¶ why not?

Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used
For Software:

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frameworks/Libraries: Leaflet.js

APIs: OpenStreetMap, Overpass API, Nominatim Geocoding API

Tools: Fetch API for asynchronous calls, basic DOM manipulation for UI

For Hardware:

None (We didn‚Äôt want actual GPS hardware involved ‚Äî that would make it useful, and we can‚Äôt have that)
